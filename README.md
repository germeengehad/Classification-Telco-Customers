# Classification Telco Customers :Project Overview
 - This project aims to classify customers into churn or non-churn categories. Churn refers to customers who have discontinued their services within the last month. The goal is to assist companies in understanding the reasons behind customer churn and predicting which customers are likely to leave the company based on available data.
- I plan to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my dataset, followed by data preprocessing, feature selection, and feature engineering. Subsequently, I intend to apply various machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost. Finally, I will evaluate the performance of these models and select the best-performing one for my dataset.
# The Data set
- The dataset is stored in a CSV file format, with each row representing a unique customer and each column containing specific attributes outlined in the column metadata. In total, the dataset comprises 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The "Churn" column serves as our target variable, indicating whether a customer has discontinued their services.
- The data set includes information about:
  -   Customers who left within the last month ( the column is called Churn)
  -  Services that each customer has signed up for ( phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies)
  -  Customer account information ( how long theyâ€™ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges)
  -  Demographic info about customers ( gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents)
